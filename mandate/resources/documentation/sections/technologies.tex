\subsection{WebAssembly}

WebAssebly (wasm) is a portable low-level language supported by all majors browsers.
It can be used for a variety of things within the browser and can be mixed
with HTML and JavaScript.
WebAssembly does not need to be parsed by the browser since it is already
in a binary format. \\
% cite variety of things with https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/
At the time fo writing, WebAssembly is not widely used
and it is not always faster than JavaScript based applications.
However, is it my opinion and hope that it will
better in the future and that it will become a standard in
web development.
