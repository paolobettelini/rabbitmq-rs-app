\subsection{Future development}

There are lots of features that could be added to the application and improvements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Deleting images, giving names to images, changing email,
        changing password and forgot password features.
    \item Source code could be more organized, readable, optimized and documented
    \item The webserver could prevent CSRF attacks
    \item The frontend design could be improved
    \item The infrastructure lacks a cache system
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Personal conclusions}

This project was exhausting but overall I am happy about it.
The project gave me the opportunity to gain a more deep
understanding of the Rust programming language. I am kind of unhappy
with how the project itself turnes out; there are lots of things
that I could have done better. I hated that fact that
the infrastructure is, by design, inherently suboptimal,
though still desirable to learn about message brokers and such designs.
The application itself is not especially \quotes{exciting}
but rather kind of boring and trivial, but I managed
to make it more interesting by using bleeding edge technologies.
\texttt{8/10} experience.
